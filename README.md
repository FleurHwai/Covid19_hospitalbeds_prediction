# Covid19_hospitalbeds_prediction

##### This project was proceeded as Ewha Global Frontier.
##### Its goal is to find correlation between population density, hospital beds and Covid-19 infection and make a Covid-19 prediction model based on the results. Furthermore, our team is looking for a way to evaluate whether the hospital beds in subjected province are enough to cover the infected.
